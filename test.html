    <h1>Problem: Days to Relax</h1>
    <p>
        You are given a list of daily productivity scores for a certain task. The productivity score of each day is represented by an integer. 
        You need to determine for each day how many days you would have to wait until a higher productivity score is recorded. 
        If there isn't a future day with a higher score, the result for that day should be <code>0</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Input:</h2>
    <p>
        An array <code>scores</code> where <code>scores[i]</code> is the productivity score recorded on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day.
    </p>

    <h2>Output:</h2>
    <p>
        Return an array <code>result</code> such that <code>result[i]</code> is the number of days you would have to wait after the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day to get a higher score. 
        If there is no future day with a higher score, set <code>result[i] = 0</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Example:</h2>
    <pre>
    <strong>Input:</strong>
    scores = [50, 55, 53, 60, 58, 70, 61]
    
    <strong>Output:</strong>
    [1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0]
    </pre>
    <p>
        <strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
        - On day 1, you must wait 1 day for a higher score (55).<br>
        - On day 2, you must wait 3 days for a higher score (60).<br>
        - On day 3, you must wait 2 days for a higher score (60).<br>
        - On day 4, you do not need to wait any days as the next day will have a lower score.<br>
        - On day 5, you must wait 1 day for a higher score (70).<br>
        - On day 6, you do not need to wait any days as there are no more days with a higher score.<br>
        - On day 7, you do not need to wait any days as there are no more days with a higher score.
    </p>

    <h2>Constraints:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ≤ length of scores ≤ 100,000</li>
        <li>30 ≤ scores[i] ≤ 100</li>
    </ul>
